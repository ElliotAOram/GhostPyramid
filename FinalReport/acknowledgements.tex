I'd like to thank Dr. Helen Miles for her continued support throughout the duration of this project which included advice and guidance on the project context and implementation. In addition I would like to thank the members of the Aberystwyth University computer science department for their assistance in setting up the stall for the prototype demonstration at the 2017 Aberystwyth Science week event.
